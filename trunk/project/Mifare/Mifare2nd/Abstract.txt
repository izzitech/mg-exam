The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC1227' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1200' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Clock Settings:
 - XTAL  =  12 MHz
 - CCLK  =  24 MHz

Example functionality:                                                   
 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 10 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART1 
 - USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC122x RAM:    runs from Internal Flash
                  (used for target debugging)

  LPC122x Flash:  runs from Internal Flash
                  (used for production or target debugging)
